Welcome to my homepage! <br>
I am a fourth-year Ph.D student at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. I got a B.S. degree in statistics from
Shandong University (GPA ranked 1st/132 with an honored degree).  <br>
My research interest is probability theory and its intersection with statistical physics and theoretical computer science. Currently I mainly work on probability theory in high-dimensional settings. <br>
